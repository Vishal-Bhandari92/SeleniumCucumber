@Add-to-cart
Feature: Adding items to cart
  I want to use this template for my feature file

  Scenario: Adding multiple items to cart - please make sure before running this test that the cart within the app is empty
    Given I am on the Home page of the demoblaze site "https://www.demoblaze.com/"
   # When I click on the login link
   # And I enter a username and password to login:
    #  | Username   | Password   |
     # | Vishal5829 | Vishal123! |
    #And I click on the login button
    #And I add samsung galaxy s6, Iphone6, Nexus6 to cart
    #When I click cart
    #Then I should see the following on the products page:
     # | Title             |
      #| Samsung galaxy s6 |
      #| Iphone 6 32gb     |
      #| Nexus 6           |
    And I sum up the items in my cart
      | Price |
      |   360 |
      |   790 |
      |   650 |
    #Then the total value of the items should be 1800
