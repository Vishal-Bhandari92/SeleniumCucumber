@Add-to-cart
Feature: Adding items to cart
  I want to use this template for my feature file

  Scenario: 
    Given I am on the Home page of the demoblaze site "https://www.demoblaze.com/"
    When I click on the login link
    And I enter a username and password to login:
      | Username   | Password   |
      | Vishal5829 | Vishal123! |
    And I click on the login button
    Then I should see "Welcome Vishal5829" as logged in
