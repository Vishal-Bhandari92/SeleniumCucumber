Feature: Log in
  I want to use this template for my feature file

 # Scenario: Logging into the app
  #  Given I am on the Home page of the demoblaze site "https://www.demoblaze.com/"
   # When I click on the login link
    #And I enter a username and password to login:
     # | Username   | Password   |
      #| Vishal5829 | Vishal123! |
    #And I click on the login button
    #Then I should see "Welcome Vishal5829" as logged in
  
  
 Scenario: User does not exist when logging in
    Given I am on the Home page of the demoblaze site "https://www.demoblaze.com/"
    When I click on the login link
    And I enter a  username and incorrect password to login:
      | Incorrect Username   | Incorrect Password   |
      | Vishal4334 | Vishal125 |
   And I click on the login button
   Then user should see a prompt that states that "User does not exist."
