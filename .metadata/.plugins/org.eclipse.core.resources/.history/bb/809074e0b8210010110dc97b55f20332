@Add-to-cart
Feature: Adding items to cart
  I want to use this template for my feature file

  Scenario: Adding multiple items to cart
    Given I am on the Home page of the demoblaze site "https://www.demoblaze.com/"
    When I click on the login link
    And I enter a username and password to login:
      | Username   | Password   |
      | Vishal5829 | Vishal123! |
    And I click on the login button
    And I add my <items> to the cart
    When I click cart
    Then I should see the following on the products page:
      | Title             | price |
      | Samsung galaxy s6 |   360 |
      | Iphone 6 32gb     |   790 |
      | Nexus 6           |   650 |
